---------- TODO ----------
- clean up transition animations
- use tone.js sampler instead of making a request for the sound every time
- api proxy to allow for more stations?
- diversify tones. ideas:
  - sound length: 1 second per bike checked out since last update
  - sound for all bikes returned
  - sound for all bikes checked out
  - sound for identified route? (when bike id shows up at new location)
