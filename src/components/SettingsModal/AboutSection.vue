      Bike rental stations are mapped by their latitude and longitude, with a grid
      sized to the browser's dimensions. The x-axis maps to notes in the C major
      pentatonic scale, and the y-axis to octaves one through five. When a bike is
      checked out or returned, the corresponding station's note plays.

      Zooming into different areas of the map changes the note and octave assigned to
      each station.
